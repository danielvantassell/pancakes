# Pancake flipper take home test

In order to determine the smallest number of flips required for making sure thatÂ·
all pancakes in any stack are always facing up, any time there is a difference
in which way a pancake is facing (determined by instructions as +- or -+) then this
counts as a flip is required. This makes sure that all previous pancakes before the
change in direction are all now aligned. Finally, if the stack is all upside down,
which can be realized by the very last value of the stack being face down (-) there
will need to be one final flip.

After beginning script, any invalid entry or out of the range as specified in the
instructions, the script will exit. If a case is given that does not contain expected
`+` or `-`, that specific use case will be skipped over. (Thought about just exiting
but nothing was explicitly stated in the instructions so I just decided to do what made sense to me.)

Requires python3.6 because 2.7 needs to die and fStrings are my friend. (I recommend
latest but sometimes we can't have nice things in life.)

# Execute Test:

`python3 -m unittest`

   Tests check for valid input, invalid input (values, length etc) as well as  examples from the instructions of what counts should be.

# Execute script


`./pancake.py`
